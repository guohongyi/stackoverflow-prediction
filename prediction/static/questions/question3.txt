I wrote a code to run a simple applet. I use java 8. the file name is SampleApplets.java. Every time when 
 I run this code in cmd prompt, the applet starts and showing a message: 'Start: applet not initialized' in the bottom of the applet.

And also I changed the comment which is present on the following code to these formats also


> code="SampleApplets.SampleApplets" width=300 height=300> 

 


AND

> code="SampleApplets.class" width=300 height=300> 


AND

 >code="SampleApplets.SampleApplets" width="300" height="300"> 


AND

 >code="SampleApplets.class" width="300" height="300"> 

AND 

>code="SampleApplets" width=300 height=300>

**The Src code starts here**

    package myPkg;

import java.applet.Applet;  
import java.awt.Graphics; 

the comment goes here... see the photo for clarity[enter image description here][1]

public class SampleApplets extends Applet {

	
	public void paint(Graphics g){  
		g.drawString("My Simple Applet",150,150);  
		}
	
}
